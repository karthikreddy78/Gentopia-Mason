Homework 3
Students are welcome to work together, but every student must write up their own solutions, inde-
pendently! I strongly encourage students to use LaTex for writing up their solutions.  Feel free to
copy this overleaf project as a template. 
Question 1: Complete a divide and conquer problem at leetcode.  Choose between problem 108
(Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree), and problem 395 (Longest Substring with at Least
K Repeating Characters).  There are many other problems on that list: if you prefer to do a differ-
ent problem instead, please ask for approval first.
